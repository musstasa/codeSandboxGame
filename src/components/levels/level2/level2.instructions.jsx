  <p>This is Marie's bedroom. She doesn't like her room and she wants some changes in styling. Let's help Marie.</p>,
  <p>Go to src/quiz folder and open level2.css file. This file contains classes for different objects in the room.</p>,
  <p>You will need to add styles for them. The slider in the bottom right will help you to write style properties correctly.</p>,
  <p>First of all let's make a quick clean up. Look at the books on the nightstand, move them to the top shelf with the help of styles.</p>,
  <p>This cactus is constantly rotating! Let's mirror it up horizontaly with the help of scale function (read the next slide ->)</p>,
  <p>The axis which is required to be reflected should be of -1 value, another one should be just 1.</p>,
  <p>The clock on the wall is 3 hours fast. Adjust the clock with the help of rotate function and right amount of degrees.</p>,
  <p>The picture looks too big for this room. Let's cut it in half with the help of scale function again. This time you should pass relative size as an argument for it.</p>,
  <p>The color of vase doesn't suit this room. Let's change it to #c69495 value.</p>,
  <p>Much better, but the room still looks dull. Let's change the color of walls to #7ed1d4.</p>,
  <p>Let's ask Marie if you've done everything correctly - click 'Check Room' button.</p>
