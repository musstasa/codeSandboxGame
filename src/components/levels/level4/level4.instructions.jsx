    Welcome back home, Mr Brown. Are you ready to have a rest? Wait, wait, wait...
  </p>,
  <p>
    You've done a lot of work today and I'm sure you don't want to loose your
    progress suddenly, do you?
  </p>,
  <p>
    To save you progress you need to create a github repository and put there
    all the source code you've written today.
  </p>,
  <p>
    Go to the Github tab on the left side of your codesandbox editor, enter a name
    for your future repository and click 'Create repository' button.
  </p>,
  <p>Nice, check your github account, a new repository should appear there!</p>,
  <p>
    Great job, but that's not all. Let's deploy your changes so that you can
    share your amazing work with friends.
  </p>,
  <p>
    Go to the Deployment tab on the left side of your codesandbox editor. Click
    'Sign In' button inside Vercel box.
  </p>,
  <p>
    Authorize with your existing github account. Then click 'Deploy with Vercel'
    -> 'Deploy sandbox'.
  </p>,
  <p>
    Switch to your deployed web page and wait a couple of minutes until application
    build is finished.
  </p>,
  <p>
    Well job, your changes are deployed now! Follow the instructions on the deployed web page.
