    In this level you need to create GitHub repository which will contain your
    code and also deploy this project to your personal domain with the help of
    Vercel.

  <h3 key="heading2">What is GitHub?</h3>,
  <p key="paragraph2">
    At a high level, GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps
    developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes
    to their code. To understand exactly what GitHub is, you need to know two
    connected principles:
    <ul>
      <li>Version control</li>
      <li>Git</li>
    </ul>
  </p>,
  <h3 key="heading3">What is Version Control?</h3>,
  <p key="paragraph3">
    Version control helps developers track and manage changes to a software
    project’s code. As a software project grows, version control becomes
    essential. Version control lets developers safely work through{" "}
    <em>branching</em> and <em>merging</em>. With branching, a developer
    duplicates part of the source code (called the repository). The developer
    can then safely make changes to that part of the code without affecting the
    rest of the project. Then, once the developer gets his or her part of the
    code working properly, he or she can merge that code back into the main
    source code to make it official. All of these changes are then tracked and
    can be reverted if need be.
  </p>,
  <h3 key="heading4">What is Git?</h3>,
  <p key="paragraph4">
    Git is a specific open-source version control system created by Linus
    Torvalds in 2005. Specifically, Git is a distributed version control system,
    which means that the entire codebase and history is available on every
    developer’s computer, which allows for easy branching and merging.
  </p>,
  <h3 key="heading5">What is Deployment?</h3>,
  <p key="paragraph5">
    Deployment is moving a website from a local environment to live servers.
    There are absolutely loads of ways to go about it, but we will use Vercel.
    Vercel is a cloud platform for websites, that you can use to deploy your
    projects to your personal domain.
